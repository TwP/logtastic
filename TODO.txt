== TODO

- Need a configuration document to store things like the level names and the columns to use in the tail table
- populate the tail window with "N hours" worth of past messages
  * possibly allow the user to select some time range to display
  * maybe this should be it's own page in the couchapp ??
  * infinite scroll on the tail window (pull in older messages as the user scrolls down)
- use the "list" and "show" capabilities of couchapp
- better formatting of messages
  - show a summary
  - hover or click to show all the details for a log event
  - format messages that are not strings (JSON arrays or objects)
- Create some daily / hourly rollup plots for the different log levels
  - filter on application level
  - use FLOT or some other charting lib (protovis ??)
- Need to create a .logging class for our tables and not pollute the global table with our stylings
- Incrementally add to the chart data based on the last collected data point
- Add to historical chart data (go back further in time) ??
- Better colors [blue, green, yellow, orange, red] instead of the use of grey and cyan


== DONE

2009/07/31
- Hourly rollup chart using FLOT

2009/07/30
- Kepp the tail table columns a fixed width
- click on "Time" in the tail window to toggle between normal dates and "pretty dates"

2009/07/29
- Make a JSON specific layout for use by the CouchDB appender
- Keep the table a fixed height, and add a scroll bar to the tbody
- Table footer with play/pause button in the tail page
- Add a count for making sure we don't spawn multiple pollers from viscious clicks of the play/pause button
